#pastel-tab
Get a new pastel color every time you open a new tab! This Chrome extension also lets you cycle through colors automatically with a customizable speed. Settings are synced with your Google account; never manually set your preferred color settings again!

This project is inspired by [automatic pastels](http://automaticpastels.tumblr.com/).

##installation
You can test this out by going to `chrome://extensions` in Chrome, enable Developer Mode, hit "Load unpacked extension" and opening the project folder.

The released version on the Chrome Web Store is coming soon, sit tight!
